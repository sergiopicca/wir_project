	<h3>The general idea for classify</h3>
	<p>
		The Google Knowledge Graph provides to us different node depending on the query we submit, in particular the subject of each query is an entity, that can be a name of a VIP, a place, whatever! The list of nodes of an entity is called from the paper's authors <strong>lineage</strong>. A tweet may have different of those entities, that may be related together, so the assumption is that related entities could have common nodes.

	</p>
	<h2>We looking for common nodes!</h2>
	<h4>...but things are not so good sometimes.</h4> 

	<p>
		In some cases we are not so lucky, because in our experiment we decided to simplify a little bit stuffs by no considering the context of a tweet, that can be web traffic in that day, events happened in that day, all the things that can influence users. Indeed...

	</p>
	<h2>...classify tweets with no context is difficult!</h2>
	<h4>We tried to do our best (finger crossed). </h4>
