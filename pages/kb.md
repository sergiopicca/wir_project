# Many functions! 
## In this python file there are many functions used during the development of the project

Among the functions written in the file, I will explain in details only the one used in the final application, going through the code. For the others I will put only a description of what that function does, avoding the functions that just print a list of nodes or write a ```.csv``` file, there are different of those, depending of which kind of version of the dataset we have to read: the unlabeled one, the one with more than one tag or the one with just one class.
